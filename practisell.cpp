// and * is here because when we create a object using the new keyword then it return the addrss so here 
// first store the address of his own this is what i think ?
// and 10 will be store in the data


Node* second = new Node(20);
// new Node(20) or other create a  Node object in the heap memory with their value
// and address of this object is store in the variable second , third etc
// Node* first stores that address.

Node* third = new Node(30);
Node* forth = new Node(40);

first->next = second; // we are assing the value of first next to the address of second intially while creating
// the object it was assign as the NULL but now we are asssigning it to second which store the address of the second

second->next = third;
third->next = forth;

// now it is working fine but now we need to print the linklist so we can see so lets create another function
// we need to get a copy of first and we need to pass it 

Node* head = first;

// Node* next;	To store the address of the next node
// new Node(10);	To create node in heap (wonâ€™t auto-delete)
// first->next = second;	Connects one node to another
